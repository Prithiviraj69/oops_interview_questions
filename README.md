# Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is meant by the term OOPs?
   - OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming.
   - It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects.
   - Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like classes, with characteristics and behaviors.

### Q2. What are the main features of OOPs?
   - Inheritance
   - Encapsulation
   - Polymorphism
   - Data Abstraction

   - An object is an instance of a class.
   - Contains the instance of members and behaviors defined in the class.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q6. What is encapsulation?
   - Encapsulation is the process of hiding unnecessary details from the user.
   - It binds data members and methods together, hiding unnecessary details.
   - Achieved through data hiding and data binding.

### Q7. What is Polymorphism?
   - Polymorphism means "many shapes."
   - It allows an entity to take multiple forms.
   - Achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q8. What is Compile time Polymorphism and how is it different from Runtime Polymorphism?
   - **Compile Time Polymorphism:**
     - Also known as Static Polymorphism.
     - Decided at compile time.
   - **Runtime Polymorphism:**
     - Also known as Dynamic Polymorphism.
     - Decided at runtime.

### Q9. What is meant by Inheritance?
   - Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object or class (child) is created using the definition of another object or class (parent).
   - Helps in code reuse and simplifies implementation.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q10. What is Abstraction?
   - Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features.
   - It focuses on the necessary functionalities while hiding implementation details.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q11. What is a constructor?
   - A constructor is a special method with the same name as the class.
   - Initializes objects when they are created.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q12. What are the various types of constructors in C++?
   - **Default constructor:**
     - Takes no arguments.
   - **Parameterized constructor:**
     - Takes arguments.
   - **Copy constructor:**
     - Initializes an object using another object of the same class.

### Q13. What is a copy constructor?
   - A copy constructor clones an object and its values into another object.
   - It is a type of constructor.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q14. What is a destructor?
   - A destructor is a special method that frees up resources and memory occupied by an object.
   - Called when an object is being destroyed.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q15. Are class and structure the same? If not, what's the difference between a class and a structure?
   - No, they are not the same.
   - Differences include memory storage and support for data abstraction.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q16. Explain Inheritance with an example?
   - Inheritance allows a child class to inherit characteristics and behaviors from a parent class.
   - Example: Vehicles (car, truck, bus) inheriting common features.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q17. Are there any limitations of Inheritance?
   - Yes, limitations include increased processing time, tight coupling, and complexity.
   - Changes in one class may affect others.

   - Multiple inheritances
   - Multi-level inheritance
   - Hierarchical inheritance
   - Hybrid inheritance

### Q19. What is a subclass?
   - A subclass is a class that inherits from another class (parent or superclass).
   - Also known as a child class.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q20. Define a superclass?
   - A superclass is a class that allows subclasses to inherit from it.
   - Also known as a parent class.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q21. What is an interface?
   - An interface is a special type of class containing method declarations without implementation.
   - Implemented by classes, and methods must be defined by the implementing class.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q22. What is meant by static polymorphism?
   - Static polymorphism or Compile-time polymorphism is linked at compile time.
   - Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q23. What is meant by dynamic polymorphism?
   - Dynamic polymorphism or Runtime polymorphism is linked at runtime.
   - Achieved through method overriding.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q24. What is the difference between overloading and overriding?
   - Overloading is compile-time polymorphism with multiple implementations of the same method in the same class.
   - Overriding is runtime polymorphism with the same method name and different implementations in parent and child classes.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q25. How is data abstraction accomplished?
   - Data abstraction is accomplished with abstract methods or abstract classes.
   - Focuses on essential functionalities while hiding implementation details.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q26. What is an abstract class?
   - An abstract class is a class containing abstract methods (only declared, not implemented).
   - Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for abstract methods.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q27. How is an abstract class different from an interface?
   - An interface contains only method declarations.
   - A subclass implementing an interface must define all methods.
   - An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q28. What are access specifiers and what is their significance?
   - Access specifiers control the accessibility of entities like classes, methods, etc.
   - Examples include "private," "public," etc.
   - Significance in achieving encapsulation.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q29. What is an exception?
   - An exception is a special event raised during program execution, causing a halt.
   - Occurs due to undesirable states like unexpected input.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q30. What is meant by exception handling?
   - Exception handling is the mechanism for identifying undesirable states and specifying desirable outcomes.
   - Prevents the execution from stopping abruptly.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q31. What is meant by Garbage Collection in OOPs world?
   - Garbage collection is the mechanism for handling memory by freeing up unwanted memory occupied by objects.
   - Ensures proper memory management.
   - [Back to Top](#oops-interview-questions)

### Q32. Can we run a Java application without implementing the OOPs concept?
   - No, Java applications are based on OOPs concepts, and they cannot be implemented without them.
   - OOPs is fundamental to Java programming.
